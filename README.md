# scfia-lib
`scfia-lib` is a library for the symbolic execution of ISA specifications written in [SISAL](https://github.com/scfia/SISAL/). It allows users to discover all reachable states which a computing system may reach, and thus prove assumptions about memory safety, control flow integrity, and real-time guarantees.
